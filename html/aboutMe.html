                <p class="aboutDescription" > Hello world! </p>
                <p class="aboutDescription" > I have been programming since I was 14 years old (currently 26). It has always been one of my passions since the first time I ever wrote a program on an old dusty computer in my schools computer labs. I find being able to create solutions to problems that I have in life with a some lines of code to be fascinating.</p>
                <p class="aboutDescription" > On the other hand I have always loved video games, and have been playing them ever since I have been able to hold a controller. Some of my fondest memories in life come from games, from the times me and my dad played Final Fantasy X together when I was young, to when I went to a friends wedding in a whole other country whom I never would have met if it weren't for games. </p>
                <p class="aboutDescription" > It has always been my dream to use my skills in programming to help create new experiences for other people to cherish and enjoy, much in the same way as many others have created for me.  </p>
